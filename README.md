# Bookable

## OVERVIEW

Bookable is a Ruby on Rails application that lets users create a list of books (including author, genre, and page count) that they either have or would like to read. Users can also track the number of pages they have read, as well as leave ratings and reviews for books they have read. Users can create an account through a traditional signup form, or sign in with an existing Goodreads account.
